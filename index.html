May years ago a blood relative was diagnosed with tuberculosis. After second and third opinion luckily we landed with Dr. Yaver who gave medicines for relief and ultimately there was no Tuberculosis. In all these years, I have time and again referred many people to him; all thanking me for the results they have achieved with Dr. Yaver's diagnosis and medicines. he has become a brand; for me whenever i hear chest or allergy the only name that comes up is Dr. Yaver proudly. I thank him for all his services to humanity and in providing us a better lifestyle.</p>

                    <p>Dr. Yaver unlike most doctors is easily accessible on his cell number. He always calls back in case he cannot attend a patient's call.</p>
                    <p>Dr Kazi has complete command over his area of specialization, i.e. lung diseases and allergies. Many small advices like taking steam and nose douching etc, which most doctors are too busy to tell their patients about, are explained and recommended by Dr. Kazi in detail.</p>

                    <p>This past winter, our 3 ½ year old daughter suffered from serious allergy and would cough the entire night coupled with nasal congestion. Sore throat and fever were routine affairs in her life. She was losing her appetite and missing school due to continuous irritating cough. We consulted the top pediatric doctors in Islamabad but to no avail. Then we visited Dr. Yaver Kazi's clinic on recommendation of our family friends. The doctor gave us ample time (around 20 to 25 min) by patiently listening to our problem and then explained the issue to us in detail (skipping the medical jargon, off course). Medication was simple and effective. Within a couple of days our child's condition started to improve and after about a week she was back to normal. We continued our follow-up visits and since then Dr. Kazi has become our family doctor. The appointments ran on time, the clinic's receptionist was courteous and it is for sure a true medical facility and not a commercial venture. For us he turned out to be the true messiah.</p>
